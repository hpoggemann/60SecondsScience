However, a series of challenges remains to be addressed before mRNA can be established as a general therapeutic modality with broad relevance to both rare and common diseases. An array of new technologies is being developed to surmount these challenges, including approaches to optimize mRNA cargos, lipid carriers with inherent tissue tropism and in vivo percutaneous delivery systems.

  abstract   = {Simple Summary
Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have the ability to specifically target tumor-cell antigens. This unique property has led to their use in the delivery of radioisotopes to tumor sites (scintigraphic imaging and radioimmunotherapy (RIT)). The choice of the radionuclide depends on its unique physical properties and intended use. Using radiolabeled mAbs with imaging techniques provides critical data that are essential for predicting side effects and determining an optimal antibody dose and treatment schedule. While RIT has been successful in the management of hematological malignancies, the treatment of solid tumors remains challenging. Various strategies are being investigated to improve the efficacy of RIT in solid tumors.

Abstract
Radioimmunoconjugates consist of a monoclonal antibody (mAb) linked to a radionuclide. Radioimmunoconjugates as theranostics tools have been in development with success, particularly in hematological malignancies, leading to approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. Radioimmunotherapy (RIT) allows for reduced toxicity compared to conventional radiation therapy and enhances the efficacy of mAbs. In addition, using radiolabeled mAbs with imaging methods provides critical information on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic agents with direct relevance to the optimization of the dose and dosing schedule, real-time antigen quantitation, antigen heterogeneity, and dynamic antigen changes. All of these parameters are critical in predicting treatment responses and identifying patients who are most likely to benefit from treatment. Historically, RITs have been less effective in solid tumors; however, several strategies are being investigated to improve their therapeutic index, including targeting patients with minimal disease burden; using pre-targeting strategies, newer radionuclides, and improved labeling techniques; and using combined modalities and locoregional application. This review provides an overview of the radiolabeled intact antibodies currently in clinical use and those in development.},

Although it may not be associated with a high mortality rate, this disease has a high morbidity rate which affects the quality of life of patients and reduces their ability to do their activities of daily living. Thankfully, the development of novel disease modifying therapies continues to increase. Monoclonal antibodies (MABs) have become a mainstay of MS treatment and they are likely to continue to be developed for the treatment of this disease. Specifically, MABs have proven to be some of the most efficacious treatments at reducing relapses and the inflammation in MS patients, including the first treatment for primary progressive MS and are being explored as reparative/remyelinating agents as well. These relatively new treatments will be reviewed here to help evaluate their efficacy, adverse events, immunogenicity, and benefit-risk ratios in the treatment of the diverse spectrum of MS. The focus will be on MABs that are currently approved or may be approved in the near future.},

  abstract     = {Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) are one of the most important classes of therapeutic proteins, which are used to treat a wide number of diseases (e.g., oncology, inflammation and autoimmune diseases). Monoclonal antibody technologies are continuing to evolve to develop medicines with increasingly improved safety profiles, with the identification of new drug targets being one key barrier for new antibody development. There are many opportunities for developing antibody formulations for better patient compliance, cost savings and lifecycle management, e.g., subcutaneous formulations. However, mAb-based medicines also have limitations that impact their clinical use; the most prominent challenges are their short pharmacokinetic properties and stability issues during manufacturing, transport and storage that can lead to aggregation and protein denaturation. The development of long acting protein formulations must maintain protein stability and be able to deliver a large enough dose over a prolonged period. Many strategies are being pursued to improve the formulation and dosage forms of antibodies to improve efficacy and to increase the range of applications for the clinical use of mAbs.},

  abstract  = {Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

Chromatin conformation is strongly affected by the composition, structural features and dynamic properties of the nucleosome, which in turn determine the nature and geometry of interactions that can occur between neighboring nucleosomes. Understanding how chromatin is spatially organized above the nucleosome level is thus essential for understanding how gene regulation is achieved. Towards this end, great effort has been made to understand how an array of nucleosomes folds into a regular chromatin fiber. This review summarizes new insights into the 3D structure of the chromatin fiber that were made possible by recent advances in cryo-electron microscopy.},

  abstract  = {Chemical reactions tend to be conceptualized in terms of individual molecules transforming into products, but are usually observed in experiments that probe the average behaviour of the ensemble. Single-molecule methods move beyond ensemble averages and reveal the statistical distribution of reaction positions, pathways and dynamics1–3. This has been shown with optical traps and scanning probe microscopy manipulating and observing individual reactions at defined locations with high spatial resolution4,5, and with modern optical methods using ultrasensitive photodetectors3,6,7 that enable high-throughput single-molecule measurements. However, effective probing of single-molecule solution chemistry remains challenging. Here we demonstrate optical imaging of single-molecule electrochemical reactions7 in aqueous solution and its use for super-resolution microscopy. The method utilizes a chemiluminescent reaction involving a ruthenium complex electrochemically generated at an electrode8, which ensures minimal background signal. This allows us to directly capture single photons of the electrochemiluminescence of individual reactions, and to develop super-resolved electrochemiluminescence microscopy for imaging the adhesion dynamics of live cells with high spatiotemporal resolution. We anticipate that our method will advance the fundamental understanding of electrochemical reactions and prove useful for bioassays and cell-imaging applications. Optical imaging of single-molecule electrochemical reactions in aqueous solution enables super-resolution electrochemiluminescence microscopy, which can be used to monitor the adhesion dynamics of live cells with high spatiotemporal resolution.},

Here, we show that conventional defocus-based cryo-EM methodologies can be used to determine high-resolution structures of specimens amassing less than 100 kDa using a transmission electron microscope operating at 200 keV coupled with a direct electron~detector. Our ~2.7 Åstructure of alcohol dehydrogenase (82 kDa) proves that bound ligands can be resolved with high fidelity to enable investigation of drug-target interactions. Our ~2.8 Åand ~3.2 Åstructures of methemoglobin demonstrate that distinct conformational states can be identified within a dataset for proteins as small as 64 kDa. Furthermore, we provide the sub-nanometer cryo-EM structure of a sub-50 kDa protein.},

  abstract = {Single-particle cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a go-to technique for structural biologists. Although data-processing and reconstruction methods have improved, innovations in sample preparation and data collection are essential to reliably achieve high-resolution reconstructions while also reducing the amount of time required per structure. Naydenova et al. tackled the issue of electron beam--induced particle movement, a major source of information loss, by designing a gold sample support that prevents buckling of the extremely thin layer of ice in which the particles are suspended (see Perspective by Rapp and Carragher). The negligible particle displacement permits extrapolation to ``zero exposure'' structure factors, revealing features typically lost in cryo-EM structures. Far fewer particles per unit resolution are required, which greatly accelerates structure determination, especially at high resolution.Science , this issue p. [223][1]; see also p. [171][2]Most information loss in cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) stems from particle movement during imaging, which remains poorly understood. We show that this movement is caused by buckling and subsequent deformation of the suspended ice, with a threshold that depends directly on the shape of the frozen water layer set by the support foil. We describe a specimen support design that eliminates buckling and reduces electron beam--induced particle movement to less than 1 angstrom. The design allows precise foil tracking during imaging with high-speed detectors, thereby lessening demands on cryostage precision and stability. It includes a maximal density of holes, which increases throughput in automated cryo-EM without degrading data quality. Movement-free imaging allows extrapolation to a three-dimensional map of the specimen at zero electron exposure, before the onset of radiation damage.

Corroborated by quantum mechanical simulations of defect formation and electronic structures, our experimental characterizations reveal that slow hopping of trapped electrons due to radiation-triggered anionic migration in host lattices can induce more than 30 days of persistent radioluminescence. We further demonstrate X-ray luminescence extension imaging with resolution greater than 20 line pairs per millimetre and optical memory longer than 15 days. These findings provide insight into mechanisms underlying X-ray energy conversion through enduring electron trapping and offer a paradigm to motivate future research in wearable X-ray detectors for patient-centred radiography and mammography, imaging-guided therapeutics, high-energy physics and deep learning in radiology.},

  abstract = {The ability to precisely control the preparation of biological samples for investigations by electron cryo-microscopy is becoming increasingly important for ultrastructural imaging in biology. Precision machining instruments such as the focused ion beam microscope (FIB) were originally developed for applications in materials science. However, today we witness a growing use of these tools in the life sciences mainly due to their versatility, since they can be used both as manipulation and as imaging devices, when complemented with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The advent of cryo-preparation equipment and accessories made it possible to pursue work on frozen-hydrated biological specimens with these two beam (FIB/SEM) instruments. In structural biology, the cryo-FIB can be used to site-specifically thin vitrified specimens for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and tomography. Having control over the specimen thickness is a decisive factor for TEM imaging, as the thickness of the object under scrutiny determines the attainable resolution. Besides its use for TEM preparation, the FIB/SEM microscope can be additionally used to obtain three-dimensional volumetric data from biological specimens. The unique combination of an imaging and precision manipulation tool allows sequentially removing material with the ion beam and imaging the milled block faces by scanning with the electron beam, an approach known as FIB/SEM tomography. This review covers both fields of cryo-FIB applications: specimen preparation for TEM cryo-tomography and volume imaging by cryo-FIB/SEM tomography.},

Here we report cryo-EM structures of the full-length Tetrahymena ribozyme in substrate-free and bound states at a resolution of 3.1 Å. Newly resolved peripheral regions form two coaxially stacked helices; these are interconnected by two kissing loop pseudoknots that wrap around the catalytic core and include two previously unforeseen (to our knowledge) tertiary interactions. The global architecture is nearly identical in both states; only the internal guide sequence and guanosine binding site undergo a large conformational change and a localized shift, respectively, upon binding of RNA substrates. These results provide a long-sought structural view of a paradigmatic RNA enzyme and signal a new era for the cryo-EM-based study of structure–function relationships in ribozymes. Cryo-electron microscopy has been used to determine the structure of the Tetrahymena ribozyme (a catalytic RNA) at sufficiently high resolution to model side chains and metal ions.},

Here, we review recent advances that have contributed to the principal methods in cryo-EM and identify persisting challenges and bottlenecks that will require further methodological and hardware development.},

It was not until several years after the advent of direct detectors that the overlooked potential of cryo-EM for studying small complexes was first realized. Subsequent advances in sample preparation, imaging, and data processing algorithms have improved our ability to visualize small biological targets. In the past two years alone, nearly two hundred high-resolution structures have been determined of small (<200kDa) macromolecules, the smallest being approximately 39kDa in molecular weight. Here we summarize some salient lessons and strategies for cryo-EM studies of small biological complexes, and also consider future prospects for routine structure determination.},

        , Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) is a structural molecular and cellular biology technique that has experienced major advances in recent years. Technological developments in image recording as well as in processing software make it possible to obtain three-dimensional reconstructions of macromolecular assemblies at near-atomic resolution that were formerly obtained only by X-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. In parallel, cryo-electron tomography has also benefitted from these technological advances, so that visualization of irregular complexes, organelles or whole cells with their molecular machines in situ has reached subnanometre resolution. Cryo-EM can therefore address a broad range of biological questions. The aim of this review is to provide a brief overview of the principles and current state of the cryo-EM field.},

  abstract  = {While the vast majority of well-structured single protein chains can now be predicted to high accuracy due to the recent AlphaFold [1] model, the prediction of multi-chain protein complexes remains a challenge in many cases. In this work, we demonstrate that an AlphaFold model trained specifically for multimeric inputs of known stoichiometry, which we call AlphaFold-Multimer, significantly increases accuracy of predicted multimeric interfaces over input-adapted single-chain AlphaFold while maintaining high intra-chain accuracy. On a benchmark dataset of 17 heterodimer proteins without templates (introduced in [2]) we achieve at least medium accuracy (DockQ [3] ≥ 0.49) on 13 targets and high accuracy (DockQ ≥ 0.8) on 7 targets, compared to 9 targets of at least medium accuracy and 4 of high accuracy for the previous state of the art system (an AlphaFold-based system from [2]). We also predict structures for a large dataset of 4,446 recent protein complexes, from which we score all non-redundant interfaces with low template identity. For heteromeric interfaces we successfully predict the interface (DockQ ≥ 0.23) in 70\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions (DockQ ≥ 0.8) in 26\% of cases, an improvement of +27 and +14 percentage points over the flexible linker modification of AlphaFold [4] respectively. For homomeric inter-faces we successfully predict the interface in 72\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions in 36\% of cases, an improvement of +8 and +7 percentage points respectively.},
